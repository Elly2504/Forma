Adidas is one of the most iconic football kit manufacturers, sponsoring clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Manchester United. Unfortunately, their popularity makes them a prime target for counterfeiters.

This guide will teach you how to authenticate any modern Adidas football kit using labels, codes, and visual details.

---

## The Product Code Label

The most reliable starting point for authenticating an Adidas kit is the product code label, usually found sewn into the neck or shoulder area. On older shirts (pre-2010), this label may be on the left side seam.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">The product code label is usually found near the neck on modern Adidas kits</figcaption>
</figure>

<InfoBox type="note">
This labeling system was introduced around 2000. Kits produced before that period may not have a product code label at all—this is normal for vintage items.
</InfoBox>

### Understanding the Product Code

Adidas product codes are typically **6-character alphanumeric strings**. Recent codes usually start with 1-2 letters followed by 4-5 numbers. Older kits may use 6-digit numeric codes.

<ProductCodeBlock 
  code="IS7462"
  label="Example Adidas Product Code"
  breakdown={[
    { part: "IS", meaning: "Product line prefix", color: "#3B82F6" },
    { part: "7462", meaning: "Unique identifier", color: "#F97316" }
  ]}
/>

Common prefix letters include:
- **IS** — Standard range
- **CW** — Club/World range
- **GM** — Game range
- **HK** — Specific collections

<InfoBox type="important" title="⚠️ CW1526: The Trending Fake Code">
**CW1526** is one of the most commonly misused product codes by counterfeiters. This code is legitimate ONLY for the **Colombia 2018 Home/Away kit**.

If you see CW1526 on ANY of these kits, it's almost certainly fake:
- Manchester United
- Juventus
- Bayern Munich
- Arsenal
- Real Madrid
- Any kit other than Colombia 2018

Counterfeiters reuse this code because it's from a popular World Cup kit. Always cross-reference the product code with the actual team on the shirt.
</InfoBox>

### Early Label Versions

Labels from 1999-2002 may look slightly different in format but contain the same essential information. This alone is not a sign the kit is fake—it's just part of Adidas's labeling evolution.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_ADIDAS_02_DATA_MATRIX.png" alt="Earlier version of Adidas product label from early 2000s" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Data Matrix code on authentic Adidas labels</figcaption>
</figure>

### The Production Code

The production code indicates when the kit was manufactured. Look for a date format like `02/10` on the label, which means **February 2010**.

<ProductCodeBlock 
  code="02/10"
  label="Production Date"
  breakdown={[
    { part: "02", meaning: "Month (February)", color: "#10B981" },
    { part: "10", meaning: "Year (2010)", color: "#8B5CF6" }
  ]}
/>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Date Mismatch = Red Flag">
If a kit claims to be from the 2023/24 season but has a production code from 2019, it's almost certainly fake. Counterfeiters often reuse old labels.
</InfoBox>

### The QR/Data Matrix Code

Modern Adidas labels feature a Data Matrix code (similar to a QR code) on the back of the product label. This is used for internal logistics and product tracking.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_ADIDAS_03_SWING_TAG.png" alt="Adidas swing tag with product information" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Authentic Adidas swing tag with team-specific product name</figcaption>
</figure>

<InfoBox type="note">
The Data Matrix encodes information like style code, manufacturing batch, and factory origin. It's readable by specialized systems used by Adidas and authorized resellers—not by standard QR code apps.
</InfoBox>

### Template Kits

When you see **two product codes** on an Adidas swing tag, it usually means the shirt is a custom design based on a standard template. This is common for:
- Smaller clubs
- Limited editions
- One-off promotional kits

One code refers to the base template, while the other represents the customized version.

### Sample Kits

Sample shirts may not follow standard labeling formats. Look for labels that clearly say "SAMPLE" inside. These aren't fake—they're pre-production prototypes created for testing or marketing.

## Swing Tags

Swing tags are the cardboard tags attached to new kits, typically hanging from the sleeve or collar.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_ADIDAS_04_CARE_LABEL.png" alt="Authentic Adidas football shirt swing tag" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Authentic Adidas care label with RN88387 and CA40312</figcaption>
</figure>

### What to Examine

| Element | What to Look For |
|---------|-----------------|
| Product code | Must match internal label |
| Barcode | Clean, scannable |
| Price tag | Regional pricing if present |
| Cardstock | Proper weight and finish |
| Printing | Sharp, no bleeding |

### Plastic Barbs vs. Twine

Adidas uses different attachment methods depending on the kit type:
- **Plastic barbs** — Standard for most retail kits
- **Twine/string** — Common on some premium or special edition kits

<InfoBox type="tip">
The shirt type code on swing tags can help identify if it's a replica or authentic version. Look for designations like "FAN" or "PLAYER" on the tag.
</InfoBox>

## Care Labels

Adidas care labels are sewn into the side seam and contain washing instructions and manufacturing information.

<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Neck label with AEROREADY or HEAT.RDY branding</figcaption>
</figure>

### Red Flags

- **Spelling errors** — Common in fakes
- **Inconsistent fonts** — Should match other Adidas labels
- **Wrong symbols** — Washing symbols follow international standards
- **Poor print quality** — Authentic labels are crisp and clear

## The Neck Label

The neck label displays size information and technology branding.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Security features on authentic Adidas kits</figcaption>
</figure>

### Technology Designations

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| AEROREADY | Standard moisture management |
| HEAT.RDY | Advanced heat management |
| COLD.RDY | Cold weather technology |
| Authentic | Player-spec construction |

### Manufacturing Countries

Authentic Adidas shirts are manufactured in:
- Thailand
- Indonesia
- Vietnam
- Cambodia
- Turkey
- China (some legitimate production)

<InfoBox type="note">
Country of manufacture alone doesn't determine authenticity. Always check multiple factors together.
</InfoBox>

## Security Tags

Modern Adidas kits include security tags for authenticity verification.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_ADIDAS_07_LOGO_DETAIL.png" alt="Adidas logo stitching detail" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Authentic Adidas three-stripe logo detail</figcaption>
</figure>

### Design Details

- Usually features **Adidas logo**
- Contains **alphanumeric code**
- Consistent **placement** across same product line

### Timeline

| Period | Security Features |
|--------|-------------------|
| Pre-2015 | Minimal or no security tags |
| 2015-2020 | Introduction of fabric tags |
| 2020+ | Enhanced security with additional codes |

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Notable Exceptions">
Some legitimate player-issue or sample kits may have different or missing security tags. Context matters.
</InfoBox>

## Logos and Crests

The Adidas logo and club crest are key visual authentication points.

<figure>

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Left: Authentic details. Right: Fake with issues.</figcaption>
</figure>

### The Adidas Logo

Adidas uses different logo variants:
- **Three Stripes** — On shoulders and sides
- **Trefoil** — Heritage/retro designs
- **Performance logo** — Modern training gear

**Key checks:**
- Even spacing between stripes
- Consistent thickness
- Clean edges (no fraying)
- Accurate placement

### Club Crests

Authentic crests feature:
- **Tight, consistent stitching**
- **Accurate colors** — No obvious shade differences
- **Sharp details** — Fine lines are actually fine
- **Proper sizing** — Measured against official specs

---

## RN56323 and CA40312

These regulatory codes appear on Adidas labels.

### What They Mean

- **RN56323** — Adidas's U.S. Federal Trade Commission registration
- **CA40312** — Canadian import identification

<InfoBox type="important">
These are NOT unique identifiers. Every Adidas product uses the same RN and CA numbers. Their presence confirms Adidas manufactured the item, but counterfeiters commonly copy them.
</InfoBox>

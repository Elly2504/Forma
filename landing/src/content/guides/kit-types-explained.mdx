Not all legitimate football kits are created equal. From replicas sold in stores to exclusive match-worn pieces, understanding the different types of shirts helps you know exactly what you're buying—and what it's worth.

---

## Replica (Fan Version)

The most common type of kit, sold at club shops, retailers, and online stores.

<ImagePlaceholder 
  id="IMAGE_TYPES_01_REPLICA" 
  alt="Standard replica/fan version football kit"
  caption="Replica kits are designed for everyday wear"
/>

### Characteristics

- **Looser, more comfortable fit**
- Slightly heavier material
- Embroidered or heat-applied crest
- Includes swing tags and retail packaging
- Washable and built for regular wear
- **Most affordable option**

<InfoBox type="note">
Replica shirts are 100% legitimate and what most fans purchase. There's nothing "fake" about them—they're just designed for fans rather than players.
</InfoBox>

### Common Names

| Brand | Replica Name |
|-------|--------------|
| Nike | Stadium |
| Adidas | Replica / Fan |
| Puma | Fan Version |

## Authentic (Player Spec)

Also called "player spec" or "match version," these are the premium retail option designed to match what players wear on the pitch.

<ImagePlaceholder 
  id="IMAGE_TYPES_02_AUTHENTIC" 
  alt="Authentic player-spec football kit"
  caption="Authentic kits feature performance materials"
/>

### Characteristics

- **Slimmer, athletic fit**
- Lighter, high-tech materials
- Heat-applied crest and logos
- Laser-cut ventilation holes
- Higher price point (typically 1.5-2x replica)
- Premium jock tags (gold/silver for Nike)

<InfoBox type="tip">
Authentic versions are great for collectors who want the closest thing to what players wear, without the exclusivity (and cost) of actual player-issue items.
</InfoBox>

### Common Names

| Brand | Authentic Name |
|-------|----------------|
| Nike | Match / Vaporknit |
| Adidas | Authentic / HEAT.RDY |
| Puma | Authentic / Pro |

## Player-Issue

Player-issue kits are produced specifically for professional players but may not have been worn in an actual match.

<ImagePlaceholder 
  id="IMAGE_TYPES_03_PLAYER_ISSUE" 
  alt="Player-issue kit with special labels"
  caption="Player-issue kits have distinctive internal markings"
/>

### Characteristics

- Same specs as authentic kits (or stricter)
- **No retail swing tags** (or store-specific ones if sold at retail)
- Unique internal codes or factory labels
- Squad customization (player name/number)
- Sometimes batch-marked for kitmen
- May include size codes specific to players

### Where They Come From

- Club shop surplus
- Kit room clearances
- Collector networks
- Player personal sales
- Charity auctions

<InfoBox type="warning">
Player-issue kits are often very similar to authentic retail versions. Without specific internal markings, it can be difficult to distinguish them. Be cautious of sellers claiming "player-issue" without proof.

## Match-Issue

Match-issue shirts are prepared for specific matches but may not have actually been worn during the game.

<ImagePlaceholder 
  id="IMAGE_TYPES_04_MATCH_ISSUE" 
  alt="Match-issue kit prepared for specific game"
  caption="Match-issue kit with match details"
/>

### Characteristics

- Custom labeling or internal tags
- **No retail branding or tags**
- Size codes for specific players
- Often includes match patches/badges
- Prepared by club kit managers
- May be identical to match-worn in construction

### Value Factors

- Significance of the match
- Player associated with the shirt
- Completeness of documentation
- Condition

<InfoBox type="example">
A match-issue England shirt prepared for a World Cup final is significantly more valuable than one prepared for a friendly, even if neither was actually worn.
</InfoBox>

## Match-Worn

The holy grail for collectors: shirts actually worn by players during competitive matches.

<ImagePlaceholder 
  id="IMAGE_TYPES_05_MATCH_WORN" 
  alt="Match-worn shirt with visible signs of use"
  caption="Match-worn items may show grass stains and wear"
/>

### Characteristics

- **Worn in an actual match** by a professional
- Specific match patches and customization
- Authentication from club or COA (Certificate of Authenticity)
- May show visible signs of wear (grass stains, sweat marks, damage)
- One-off detailing for the specific game
- **Highest value category**

### Authentication Considerations

Match-worn items require rigorous verification:
- Photomatch to game footage
- Club documentation
- Chain of custody
- Expert authentication services

<InfoBox type="important" title="Buyer Beware">
The match-worn market has significant fraud. Always require comprehensive documentation and be skeptical of prices that seem too good to be true.

## Samples

Sample shirts are pre-production prototypes created for internal testing, promotional use, or approval processes.

<ImagePlaceholder 
  id="IMAGE_TYPES_06_SAMPLE" 
  alt="Sample shirt with SAMPLE marking"
  caption="Sample kits often have clear internal markings"
/>

### Characteristics

- May include "SAMPLE" printed inside
- Sometimes missing official branding, sponsors, or tags
- May differ from final released versions
- Often lack retail product codes
- Use placeholder codes
- Rare and collectible due to uniqueness

### Why They Exist

- Design testing
- Fit and material evaluation
- Marketing and PR purposes
- Approval submissions to clubs/organizations
- Photography and promotional shoots

<InfoBox type="note">
samples offer a behind-the-scenes look at kit development. They're like a "rough draft" of the final product.

## Vintage Categories

For pre-2000 shirts, additional distinctions apply:

### Original vs Reissue

| Aspect | Original | Reissue |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Production | Period-correct | Modern production |
| Materials | Era-specific | Often updated |
| Labels | Period labeling | Modern tags, often marked "reissue" |
| Value | Higher (usually) | Lower |
| Condition | Variable | New |

### Template vs Club-Specific

Some vintage templates were used across multiple clubs. A template kit is authentic but was mass-produced, while club-specific pieces were customized for particular teams.

## Value Hierarchy

Generally speaking, kit values follow this hierarchy:

1. **Match-Worn** — Highest value
2. **Match-Issue** — High value
3. **Player-Issue** — Above retail
4. **Authentic/Player Spec** — Premium retail
5. **Replica/Fan** — Standard retail

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Condition Matters More">
A pristine replica in perfect condition can be worth more than a damaged authentic version. Condition is often the biggest value factor within each category.

## Summary Table

## Key Takeaways

1. **All types can be genuine** — "Replica" doesn't mean fake
2. **Know what you're paying for** — Match seller claims to kit type
3. **Documentation matters** — Especially for player-issue and above
4. **Condition affects value** — Sometimes more than kit type
5. **Era affects expectations** — Vintage kits follow different rules

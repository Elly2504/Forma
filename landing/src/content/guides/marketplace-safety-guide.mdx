## The Cage: The Biggest Red Flag

If you see only one thing from this guide, let it be this.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #ef4444; margin-top: 0.5rem; font-weight: bold;">🚨 The infamous 'Cage' backdrop - a major red flag</figcaption>
</figure>

<InfoBox type="important" title="🚨 The Cage = Almost Always Fake">
**"The Cage"** refers to a distinctive metal grid or mesh backdrop seen in photos of counterfeit football kits. This setup is strongly associated with:

- Mass-produced fakes
- Bulk sellers (often based in Asia)
- Listings with multiple "new with tags" kits

If you see this backdrop, **walk away immediately**. It's rarely (if ever) used by genuine individual sellers.
</InfoBox>

### Why The Cage Exists

Counterfeit operations photograph hundreds of fake kits for online listings. The metal cage/grid provides a consistent, professional-looking backdrop for product photography at scale.

Legitimate sellers typically photograph kits:
- On a bed or floor
- Hanging on a door
- On a mannequin or hanger
- With personal touches (their home visible)

## Photo Red Flags

### Stock Photos

<InfoBox type="warning" title="No Real Photos = No Sale">
If a listing uses only stock photos or promotional images without showing the actual item, don't buy. Always request real photos of:
- Front and back of the shirt
- Inside labels (product code, care label, neck label)
- Close-ups of crest and logos
- Any swing tags
</InfoBox>

### Reverse Image Search

Use Google Images or TinEye to check if the photos appear elsewhere:

1. Right-click the listing image
2. Select "Search image with Google" (or upload to TinEye)
3. If the same photos appear on multiple listings from different sellers, they're stolen

### Inconsistent Photos

Watch for:
- Different lighting/backgrounds between photos
- Different shirt quality in different angles
- Obvious editing or cropping

## Seller Red Flags

### New Accounts with Premium Inventory

<InfoBox type="warning">
A brand new seller with 50+ "rare vintage" kits in perfect condition? Almost certainly a bulk counterfeit operation.
</InfoBox>

### Check Seller History

| Platform | What to Check |
|----------|---------------|
| eBay | Feedback score, years active, recent reviews |
| Vinted | Number of sales, buyer reviews, account age |
| Depop | Reviews, follower count, sold items |
| Facebook | Profile age, mutual friends, marketplace history |

### Multiple Identical Listings

Legitimate collectors rarely have 5 identical kits in different sizes. Counterfeiters do.

## Price Red Flags

<InfoBox type="tip" title="If It's Too Good To Be True...">
A rare 1996 England shirt with tags for £30? A 2010 Inter Milan Champions League kit for €25? These prices are unrealistic for authentic items.

Use sold listings on eBay to gauge realistic prices for specific kits.
</InfoBox>

### Price Reality Check

| Kit Type | Fake Price | Real Price |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Recent season replica | £15-25 | £40-70 |
| Vintage 1990s (common) | £20-40 | £80-150 |
| Vintage 1990s (rare) | £30-50 | £150-400+ |
| Player-issue modern | £50-80 | £120-250 |

## Product Code Verification

Always check the product code:

1. Ask the seller for a photo of the internal product code label
2. Search the code online (or use our database)
3. Verify the code matches the kit being sold

<InfoBox type="example" title="Common Fake Code Example">
**CW1526** is a legitimate Adidas code for the Colombia 2018 kit. If you see this code on a Manchester United or Bayern Munich kit, it's 100% fake.
</InfoBox>

### What to Ask Sellers

> "Hi! Could you please send photos of the internal labels, including the product code? Thanks!"

Legitimate sellers are happy to provide this. Scammers will often ghost you or make excuses.

## Got Scammed?

If you've already purchased a fake:

1. **Document everything** — Screenshots of listing, messages, photos

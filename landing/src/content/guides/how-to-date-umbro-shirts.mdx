## 1. The 1980s Era (1980-1989)

The 1980s represent Umbro's classic era—heavy cotton, simple labeling, and distinctive logo features.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">1980s Umbro logo with lowercase wordmark</figcaption>
</figure>

### Logo Characteristics
- **Lowercase "umbro"** wordmark beneath double-diamond
- **Thick, closely arranged characters**
- **Sharp pointed diamond corners** (not rounded)
- Logo often embroidered rather than printed

### Label Features
- Simple single-language tags
- Basic size and care information
- **"Made in England"** or **"Made in Scotland"** common
- No product codes on most pieces

### Fabric & Construction
- Heavy cotton or cotton/polyester blends
- Substantial weight (feels heavier than modern kits)
- Diamond taping pattern on sleeves and shorts

<InfoBox type="tip" title="1980s Quick Check">
If the shirt has lowercase "umbro" lettering AND feels heavy like cotton, you're likely looking at a genuine 1980s piece.

## 2. The 1990s Era (1990-1999)

The 1990s brought significant changes to Umbro's branding and labeling—and introduced the infamous **Dots Test**.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">1990s Pro Training era neck label with dots in UMBRO</figcaption>
</figure>

### Logo Evolution (1990-1999)

| Period | Changes |
|--------|---------|
| 1990-1992 | Wordmark becomes **UPPERCASE** and wider |
| Mid-1990s | Blocky, bold "UMBRO" text |
| Late 1990s | Letters and diamonds become **slimmer** |

### The Dots Test (Critical!)

<InfoBox type="important" title="🔍 The Most Reliable 1990s Dating Method">
Authentic 1990s Umbro neck labels have **tiny dots within the letters of "UMBRO"**. 

- **Authentic:** Clear, distinct dots visible in each letter
- **Fake/Wrong Era:** Flat, smooth letters with no dots

This detail is extremely difficult for counterfeiters to replicate. If you see a blue 1990s-style label with NO dots in the text, the shirt is likely fake or from a different era.
</InfoBox>

### Label Features
- **Blue neck labels** (often with white size label underneath)
- Dots within "UMBRO" lettering
- "Made in England" or "Made in Portugal" common
- Mid-1990s: Morocco manufacturing begins

### Pro Training Designation
The "Pro Training" line was Umbro's premium player-spec range:
- Heavier construction
- Embroidered badges
- Made for professional use
- Commands higher prices today

<InfoBox type="example" title="Iconic 1990s Dating Example">
**England Euro 96 Home Shirt:**
- Blue neck label with DOTS in UMBRO
- "Made in England" care label
- Pro Training designation
- Heavy cotton-blend fabric
- UPPERCASE blocky lettering on logo

## 3. The 2000s Era (2000-2007)

The 2000s brought modernization with slimmer designs and standardized labeling.

  <img src="/IMAGE_UMBRO_03_MODERN_LABEL.png" alt="2000s Umbro modern label style" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">2000s modern Umbro labeling</figcaption>
</figure>

### Logo Characteristics
- Diamond becomes **horizontally elongated**
- Upper vertices curve toward center
- Softer, more rounded corners (vs. sharp 1980s corners)
- Letters become lighter and thinner
- Wordmark sometimes less legible due to thin font

### Label Features
- **Large, shiny polyester wash tags** replace smaller cotton labels
- Multi-language care instructions
- China, Indonesia, Thailand manufacturing predominant
- Product codes begin appearing consistently

### Key Visual Markers

| Feature | 1990s | 2000s |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Diamond corners | Sharp | Rounded/soft |
| UMBRO letters | Thick, blocky | Thin, slim |
| Wash label | Small, 1-2 languages | Large, multi-language |
| Manufacturing | UK/Portugal/Morocco | Asia (China, Thailand) |

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Manufacturing Country Dating">
A shirt claimed to be from 1990 but with a "Made in China" label is almost certainly **misdated or fake**. China manufacturing became common only in the 2000s.
</InfoBox>

## 4. The Nike Era (2008-2012)

Nike acquired Umbro in 2008, bringing significant changes to production and labeling.

### Distinctive Features
- **Wordmark removed** from logo (just double-diamond)
- Diamond extended to near-original proportions
- Edges remain softened and rounded (not sharp like 1980s)
- Nike-style labeling and manufacturing standards
- Made in Nike factories (same countries as Nike production)

<InfoBox type="note" title="Nike Era Authenticity">
Nike-style labels on Umbro kits from 2008-2012 are **completely authentic**. Nike owned Umbro during this period, so the manufacturing standards reflected Nike's processes.
</InfoBox>

### Post-2012 (Iconix Era)
After Nike sold Umbro to Iconix in 2012:
- Wordmark returns (lowercase, slim font similar to 1980s)
- Heritage focus with nostalgic designs
- Modern manufacturing continues (Asia-based)

## 5. Key Sponsorship Dates for Context

Use these historical markers to verify dating claims:

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1954-2022 | England national team (longest partnership in football) |
| 1974 | Double-diamond logo introduced |
| 1990 | England World Cup (Gazza's tears) |
| 1996 | England Euro '96 (home tournament, iconic home shirt) |
| 2008 | Nike acquires Umbro |
| 2012 | Iconix acquires Umbro |

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Dating by Event">
If someone claims an "England Euro 96" shirt, check that all era markers match: UPPERCASE logo, blue label with dots, Made in England, heavy cotton blend. Any mismatch indicates a fake or incorrect attribution.
</InfoBox>

<GuideFAQ items={[
  {
    question: "How do I quickly identify a 1990s Umbro shirt?",
    answer: "Look for three key indicators: UPPERCASE 'UMBRO' logo, blue neck label with tiny dots within the letters, and 'Made in England' or 'Made in Portugal' manufacturing. The dots test is the most reliable method."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Umbro 'Dots Test'?",
    answer: "Authentic 1990s Umbro neck labels have tiny dots within each letter of 'UMBRO'. Labels without dots are either fake or from a different era. This detail is extremely difficult for counterfeiters to replicate."
  },
  {
    question: "When did Umbro change from lowercase to UPPERCASE logo?",
    answer: "Around 1990-1992, Umbro changed from lowercase 'umbro' to UPPERCASE 'UMBRO'. The wordmark became wider and blockier during the early 1990s, then slimmer toward the late 1990s."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I tell if a 'Made in China' Umbro is fake?",
    answer: "Check the era it claims to be from. China manufacturing became common only in the 2000s. A shirt claiming to be from 1990 or earlier with 'Made in China' is almost certainly misdated or fake."
  },
  {
    question: "What happened during the Nike ownership period (2008-2012)?",
    answer: "Nike removed the UMBRO wordmark (leaving just the double-diamond), used Nike-style labeling, and manufactured in Nike factories. These characteristics are authentic for that period."
  },
  {
    question: "Are Pro Training Umbro shirts more valuable?",
    answer: "Yes. Pro Training was Umbro's premium player-spec line with heavier construction, embroidered badges, and better fabric quality. They're rarer and command higher prices than standard replicas."

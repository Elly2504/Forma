Puma sponsors major clubs like Manchester City, AC Milan, and Borussia Dortmund. Their kits are popular among collectors, which unfortunately makes them targets for counterfeiters.

This guide covers everything you need to authenticate Puma football kits.

## The Product Code Label

Puma product codes are found on a large label typically sewn into the left side of the shirt. It's labeled as either "Style No" or "Article No."

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Puma product label is usually on the left side seam</figcaption>
</figure>

<InfoBox type="note">
This labeling system was introduced around 2000. Pre-2000 vintage Puma kits may not have a product code label.
</InfoBox>

### Understanding the Product Code

Puma product codes are typically **6-digit numeric strings**, often followed by a **2-digit variant code**.

<ProductCodeBlock 
  code="736251-01"
  label="Example Puma Product Code"
  breakdown={[
    { part: "736251", meaning: "Style number", color: "#10B981" },
    { part: "01", meaning: "Color variant", color: "#F97316" }
  ]}
/>

<InfoBox type="tip">
The 2-digit variant code became consistent on labels from the 2018/19 season onwards. Earlier kits might only show it on swing tags.
</InfoBox>

### Production Date

Modern Puma labels include the actual production date. This is extremely helpful for authentication.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_PUMA_02_PRODUCTION_DATE.png" alt="Puma label showing production date" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Production date clearly visible on modern Puma labels</figcaption>
</figure>

<InfoBox type="warning">
If the production date doesn't align with the season (e.g., a 2023/24 kit produced in 2019), it's almost certainly fake.
</InfoBox>

### Production Region Codes

Puma labels include a code indicating the manufacturing region. For example: `TVNAO`

<ProductCodeBlock 
  code="TVNAO"
  label="Factory Code Breakdown"
  breakdown={[
    { part: "T", meaning: "Type identifier", color: "#8B5CF6" },
    { part: "VN", meaning: "Country (Vietnam)", color: "#3B82F6" },
    { part: "AO", meaning: "Factory code", color: "#10B981" }
  ]}
/>

The country code should match what's printed in the "Made in..." section:
- **VN** = Vietnam
- **TH** = Thailand
- **KH** = Cambodia
- **ID** = Indonesia

<InfoBox type="example" title="Factory Verification">
You can cross-reference factory codes with Puma's published factory lists. For example, "AO" in Vietnam corresponds to **Alliance One Apparel Co., Ltd.** in Ben Tre Province.
</InfoBox>

### Market Region Codes

Puma labels also show the intended market region. Common codes:

| Code | Region |
|------|--------|
| EUR | Europe |
| NAM | North America |
| ASI | Asia-Pacific |
| LAT | Latin America |

This helps identify region-specific releases.

## Swing Tags

Puma swing tags contain product information and barcodes.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Puma swing tag with product details</figcaption>
</figure>

### What to Check

- **Product code** — Must match internal label
- **Barcode** — Clean and scannable
- **Design quality** — Sharp printing, proper cardstock
- **Holographic elements** — Some tags include security features

### Design Consistency

Puma updates swing tag designs periodically. Compare against known authentic examples from the same season.

## Care Labels

Care labels are sewn into the side seam with washing instructions and manufacturing details.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_PUMA_04_CARE_LABEL.png" alt="Puma care label with washing instructions" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Authentic Puma care label</figcaption>
</figure>

### Red Flags

- Spelling mistakes
- Incorrect washing symbols
- Poor print quality
- Inconsistent fonts

## The Neck Label

Puma neck labels show size information and technology branding.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Neck label featuring dryCELL technology</figcaption>
</figure>

### Technology Branding

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| dryCELL | Standard moisture management |
| ultraweave | Lightweight performance fabric |
| EVOKNIT | Premium knit construction |
| Authentic | Player-spec version |

---

## Security Tags

Modern Puma kits include security features.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Security tag on modern Puma kits</figcaption>
</figure>

Security measures have evolved over the years, with newer kits having more sophisticated anti-counterfeiting features.

## Logos and Crests

The Puma cat logo and club crests are common failure points for counterfeits.

<figure>
  <img src="/IMAGE_PUMA_07_LOGO_DETAIL.png" alt="Close-up of authentic Puma cat logo" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; border-radius: 8px;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; color: #a1a1aa; margin-top: 0.5rem;">Authentic Puma logo with clean lines</figcaption>
</figure>

### The Puma Logo

**Authentic characteristics:**
- Clean, fluid shape
- Consistent stitching or heat-press quality
- Accurate proportions
- No visible defects

### Club Crests

Check for:
- Sharp detail definition
- Accurate colors
- Even stitching density
- Proper sizing

<InfoBox type="example">
On high-quality authentic crests, fine details like stars or text remain clearly legible. Fakes often blur or simplify these elements.
</InfoBox>

## RN62200 and CA06311

These regulatory codes appear on Puma labels.

### What They Mean

- **RN62200** — Puma's U.S. Federal Trade Commission registration
- **CA06311** — Canadian import identification

<InfoBox type="important">
These are NOT unique to individual products. Every Puma item uses the same codes. Counterfeits commonly replicate them.
</InfoBox>

## What is a Nike Product Code?

Every authentic Nike football shirt produced since the early 2000s contains a unique **Product Code** (also known as **MPN** - Manufacturer Part Number). This code is your single most reliable tool for verifying authenticity.

Think of it as a shirt fingerprint - no two different shirt designs share the same code.

> **Key Insight:** Product codes were introduced specifically to combat counterfeiting. If a shirt code does not match its claimed identity, it is almost certainly fake.

## Where to Find the Product Code

Nike product codes are located on a **small label beneath the main wash label**, usually near the hem of the shirt.

### Label Location by Era

| Era | Location |
|-----|----------|
| 2000-2010 | Bottom hem, left side (inside) |
| 2010-2015 | Bottom hem, center (inside) |
| 2015-Present | Bottom hem, left or center |

### What the Label Looks Like

The label contains:
1. **Style Code** (6 digits) - identifies the shirt design
2. **Color Code** (3 digits) - identifies the colorway
3. **Season Code** (e.g., HO15) - production period

**Example:** `847284-010 HO15`

## How to Decode Nike Product Codes

### The Format: XXXXXX-YYY

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **XXXXXX** | Style number (shirt design) | 847284 |
| **YYY** | Color code | 010 (usually black accent) |

### Common Color Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 010 | Black |
| 100 | White |
| 410 | Navy Blue |
| 657 | Red |
| 480 | Royal Blue |

### Season Codes Explained

Nike operates on a 4-season production cycle:

| Code | Season | Months |
|------|--------|--------|
| **SP** | Spring | January - March |
| **SU** | Summer | April - June |
| **FA** | Fall | July - September |
| **HO** | Holiday | October - December |

The two digits after the season code indicate the **year**.

**Example:** `FA16` = Fall 2016 (July-September 2016)

## How to Verify a Product Code (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: Google Search Verification

This is the fastest and most reliable method:

1. **Copy the full code** (e.g., `847284-010`)
2. **Search on Google:** `"847284-010" football shirt`
3. **Check the results:**
   - **Match:** Images show the same shirt you have
   - **Mismatch:** Images show a different shirt = FAKE

### Method 2: Cross-Reference with Retailers

Official Nike and major retailers (JD Sports, Pro:Direct) often list product codes. Search:
- Nike.com product pages
- eBay sold listings (filter by Sold)
- Classic Football Shirts archived listings

## Red Flags: How Fakes Get It Wrong

### 1. Wrong Code for the Shirt

The most common fake indicator. A 2018 Manchester United Home shirt with a code that Google shows as a 2016 PSG Away is 100% fake.

### 2. Generic or Missing Codes

Fakes often use:
- Repeated digits: `123456-123`
- Codes from unrelated Nike products (shoes, training gear)
- No code at all

### 3. Label Quality Issues

| Authentic | Fake |
|-----------|------|
| Clean, precise printing | Blurry or smudged text |
| Consistent spacing | Uneven character spacing |
| Proper Nike font | Slightly off font |

### 4. Wrong Season Code

A shirt supposedly from the 2022/23 season should not have a `FA19` (Fall 2019) production code.

## Pre-2000 Shirts: What About Vintage?

Shirts from before 2000-2002 **typically do not have product codes**. Authentication for these relies on:

- Label style and font accuracy
- Fabric texture and weight
- Stitching patterns
- Historical accuracy (correct sponsor, badge placement)

We are building a separate guide for pre-code vintage authentication.

## Quick Authentication Checklist
